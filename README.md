# Hierarchical Risk Parity - Portfolio Optimisation Technique

In this project we explore the method of HRP for porfolio composition which has well diversified risk. And we compare it's performance against conventional portfolio optimisation technique such as Markowitz Mean-Variance(MVP) Portfolio. 

**Algorithm** -  The HRP algorithm has been taken from the paper [Marcos Lopez de Prado (2016)](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2708678)

**Data** - The data has been extracted from *yahoo finance* . We select Nifty 500 companies and fetch their Closing prices for 2  yrs Jan-2020 to Dec-2021 . This is training dataset and test dataset is for 1 year Jan-2022 to Dec-2022
